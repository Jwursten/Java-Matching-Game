# Java-Matching-Game
# Overview

I wanted to learn more about Java and how I can use it with HTML and CSS. 

I created a matching game. I made an array of cards representing the pairs. Then the cards are duplicated. Then They are shuffled using an algorithm. Each card has event listeners that listen for clicks. When a card is clicked it is "Flipped" and when the next card is flipped it checks to see if they are the same.
